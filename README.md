# python
This is my python repo that contains most of the stuff I am learning and been learning to master python. I am teaching my self using the books in the
(books consulted) dir. I am an aspiring senior software engineer that looks up to working at great companies of the world(Tech giants). 
The books I read are quite many including the best selling "Automate the boring stuff with python" by Al Sweigart and "Apprenez Ã  programmer en python" by Prolixe from open classrooms,however,it is a french book but really good for those that love to have quite a deep understanding of the programming language for beginners.
"WHAT THE MIND CONCEIVES,THE MIND PERCEIVES"
"YOU DO NOT NEED ANYONE'S PERMISSION TO SUCCEED"
