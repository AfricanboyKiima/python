#The lambda function is used in certain cases where it's not practical to use the define function
#one example is if i just want to write a function that returns the square of a number
#example : lambda x: x * x  The only way of calling this function is through use of a variable that will store our called function
#function = lambda x:x*x
function = lambda x,y:x-y
