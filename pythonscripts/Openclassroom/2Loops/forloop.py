#FOR LOOP,many programmng languages have a while loop,they also do have the...
#.."for" loop ,for instance java and c++ but their "for" loops do not have the same meaning.
"""
For loops are used to deal with sequencies i.e series of events that follow one another,they are specialised in covering sequencies of several data.
The structure of a for loop is as follows:
# for element in sequence: #
"element is" a variable that is instantiated by the for instruction,it is a variable that successively
...takes values from the sequence that is being covered as the for instruction is covering the sequence.
EXPLANATION.
The for loop covers the sequence
Initially,the for instruction had created a variable,this variable then successively takes each value that has been covered by the for loop this means the for instruction
and the variable work simultaneously as the variable only takes in when the for instruction has covered each item of the sequence.
for instruction covers,variable takes the values,for covers,variable takes that covered value,for covers again and variable aslo takes again,
this process is continued until the for instruction stops covering the sequence or at the end of the sequence.
The element variable successively takes the values of the sequence that is being covered
SYNTAX
#for element in sequence#
when dealing with the for loop,onething to note is that the for loop instaintiates a variable which succcesively takes values of the sequence
that has been coveredby the for loop.
