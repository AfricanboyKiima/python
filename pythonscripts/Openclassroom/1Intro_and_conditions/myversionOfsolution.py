#This code is my own review code of openclassroom's LEAPYEAR testing
#In other words,it's a python script that tests if a year can be a leap one or not.

NASA PERSONNAL RESEARCH
According to nasa's website,a year has approximately 365.25 days,however,in a calender year,a year is made of 365 days i.e Sollar year,
in order to make up for the remaing days,after four years,a day is added to one of the months of the year which is february,
we normally have 28 days in february but in other years,we find that it is made of 29 days i.e
Let's look at an example

2004 = leap year
2005 = Not leap year
2006 = Not leap year
2007 = Not leap year
2008 = Leap year
From the above,we notice that approximately after every four years,a day is added to a year making it 366 days instead of 365 days that we normally have

EXPLANATION
if it is a multiple of four,
then check if it is a multiple of four and a hundred,
else,check if it is a multiple of four hundred
if it is a multiple of four only,then it is a leap year
if it is a multiple of both four and one hundred ,
then it is not a leap year,
if it is a multiple of 400 too,then it is also a leap year.
